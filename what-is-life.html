<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> What is Life?<a href="what-is-life.html#what-is-life" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>One of the key drivers for Rolando Toro to develop his System of Biodanza was the disconnection he observed of men and women from the cosmic matrix, throughout our Western history, which has generated destructive cultural forms. This resulted from our Cartesian way of thinking, which caused a fragmented view of life. Indeed, it implied a division between body and mind, humanity and nature, living matter and non-living matter, and it considers the universe as being analyzable in separately existing parts that more or less interact as parts of a machine <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bohm1980" role="doc-biblioref">Bohm 1980</a>)</span>. This fragmented world view disconnected us from the universe that we inhabit and broke up our human society into distinct religious, political, economical and racial groups, among others leading to the exploitation of our natural resources, plants, animals and of fellow humans.</p>
<p>Ronando, therefore, has put his biocentric principle against this old world view. When formulating his principle, Rolando started from the axiom that “life is the essential condition for the genesis of the universe”. In his book on Biodanza <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-toro2008" role="doc-biblioref">Toro 2008</a>)</span> he refers to the universe as a living hologram or the matrix of life, i.e. a self-organising structure that is building life, and his view is that the entire cosmos has to be understood as a gigantic living system, by itself. This principle invites us to radically rethink our relationship as a human being with the entire biosphere that we inhabit. From this point of view, life itself is intrinsically sacred, which probes us to put all living beings, or all of life, at the heart of our weltanschauung.</p>
<p>From my scientific background, however, the axiom that “life is the essential condition for the genesis of the universe” appeared rather radical. However, I immediately felt that Biocentrism “an sich”, which starts from the deep astonishment that life, as we know it, simply exists, and puts it at the hearth of our weltanschauung was key for Rolando’s system of Biodanza. Indeed, it starts from the simple fact that life exists, here and now, and that cognition and human growth originate through the vivencia of life. The latter can trigger us to think about our origin and our place in the universe, but more important than these thoughts is the experience, which promotes a deeper cognition from within, and this immediately with our embodied mind that is touched by vivencia.</p>
<p>With his axiom, however, Rolando went one step further. Indeed, in his book on Biodanza <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-toro2008" role="doc-biblioref">Toro 2008</a>)</span>, he explicitly mentions that “The universe exists because life exists”, and not that “Life exists because the universe exists”, which triggered me to try to grasp his views on the matter. I quickly learnt that Rolando’s rationale is deeply rooted in the work of leading scientists. Indeed, Rolando often refers to Christian de Duve and his quotes “Life is a cosmic imperative” and “Life is an obligatory manifestation of matter, written into the fabric of the universe”, Ilya Prigogine’s “dissipative structures”, “dissipative zones” and “attractors”, and Maturana and Varella’s “autopoesis” and “autopoetic units”, among others. Many of these were concepts to which I had never been exposed in my formal scientific education and that I could not comprehend without consulting the work of the original authors.</p>
<p>When thinking about science, however, it is crucial, as <span class="citation">Bohm (<a href="#ref-bohm1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> nicely formulates, to acknowledge that scientific theories are not “true knowledge” corresponding to “the reality as is”, but rather ever-changing insights that are giving shape and form to how we view and experience the world. This reflects my quest in this monograph: to shed light on Rolando’s insights on biological aspects, which he enfolded in his model of Biodanza.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Rolando Toro’s View of Life and his Biocentric Principle<a href="what-is-life.html#rolando-toros-view-of-life-and-his-biocentric-principle" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In his book of Biodanza Rolando argues that the universe can be understood as a living system and that “the realm of life embraces much more than the plants, the animals and man. Everything that exists, from neutrinos to quasars, from the fine stone to the most subtle thought, is a part of this prodigious living system”, which he often refers to as a gigantic living hologram.</p>

<p>Where did Rolando’s holographic analogy for the universe come from?
The term “hologram” was coined for a photographic recording of a light field that originates by the interference<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of an incoming light beam with the light of this beam that has been scattered by illuminating an object.
From the recording a 3D image can than reconstructed e.g. see figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:hologram1">2.1</a>. The recording at every spot on the photographic plate is the result of the interference of light waves that are scattered by all locations of the object. Each part of the record thus contains information of the whole object unlike a traditional photograph where there is a point-to-point correspondence of the object and the recorded image. As <span class="citation">Bohm (<a href="#ref-bohm1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> nicely phrases it “form and structure of the entire object may be said to be enfolded within each region of the photographic record” and “when one shines light on any region, this form and structure are unfolded to give a recognizable image of the whole object once again”.</p>

<p>In quantum mechanics, both matter and electromagnetic waves (such as light, microwaves and X-rays amongst others) have a particle and wave character, and every physical structure is defined by a wave function that in principle extends over the whole universe. As <span class="citation">Bohm (<a href="#ref-bohm1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> points out in an insightful example: “when we look to the night sky we are able to discern structures covering immense stretches of space and time, which are in some sense contained in the movements of light in the tiny space encompassed by the eye and (…) also how instruments (…) can discern more and more of this totality, contained in each region of space.” This illustrates how according to these insights, information on the entire universe, or on its <em>total order</em>, is <em>enfolded</em> or contained in some implicit sense, in every region of space-time and how it can be <em>unfolded</em> by our eye or instruments. <span class="citation">Bohm (<a href="#ref-bohm1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> further argues that this enfoldment and unfoldment does not only applies to light waves, but extends to electromagnetic waves in general, as well as to other waves such as to the electronic, protonic, gravitational, sound waves, etc. and even towards fields that are yet unknown and may be discovered later.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Bohm (<a href="#ref-bohm1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> therefore replaced the old Cartesian analogy of the universe as a machine by a novel analogy: that of a holographic universe, which refers to its unbroken and undivided totality that is enfolded in every region of space-time.</p>
<p>So when Rolando was referring to the universe as a living hologram, he expressed his view that life is part of this unbroken and undivided totality that is enfolded in every region of space-time.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of this view, we will introduce Bohm’s example of a seed from which an entire plant is growing. The plant is also holographic. Indeed each of its cells contains all information from the seed, i.e. all its DNA as well as its cellular structure. <span class="citation">Bohm (<a href="#ref-bohm1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> further points out that the seed contains little to nothing from the actual biomass of the plant that it has developed. The seed merely contains the information that is required to transform its environment to grow the plant from solar energy and the chaos of simple molecules CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>, nitrogen, phosphorous, etc. Remarkably, the plant will eventually produce new seeds, which will spread its information further throughout the environment and will transform it over and over again to grow plants. It thus becomes obvious that we no longer need to make the distinction between “inanimated” and “animated” matter. Indeed, if we would stick to this old Cartesian way of thinking we are confronted with confusing questions like when would a so-called “inanimated” carbon atom become animated? As soon as it enters the leaf stomata or when it transformed into an organic compound? Does the carbon atom becomes inanimated again when it is released from the plant as it burns the sugars it has assimilated into CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> during the night? All these confusing questions spontaneously resolve when considering the universe as an unbroken and undivided totality. Indeed, from this paradigm we consider that the environment is augmented with the information of the seed, which somehow seems to direct its environment to grow a corresponding plant. So life itself can be regarded as belonging to a totality including plant and the environment. Life is somehow enfolded in this totality and already implicitly present even before it is unfolded and explicitly manifests itself. Indeed, the ensemble of all atoms that eventually will form the plant that will grow from a certain seed are already present in the environment. In this way, so-called “inanimated matter” can be seen as a subtotality of the whole in which life can be unfolded, for instance when the environment is enriched with the information from a plant seed. So <span class="citation">Bohm (<a href="#ref-bohm1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> concludes that “we do not need to fragment the whole into life and inanimated matter, nor do we have to try to reduce life completely to nothing but an outcome of the latter”.</p>

<p>Rolando also referred to the universe as a self-organising structure that is building life. The universe as we know it likely started off with the big bang: a massive spike of energy. Shortly after the big bang, matter was formed. As <span class="citation">Davies (<a href="#ref-davies1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span> describes it, this matter was rather formless existing of subatomic particles more or less uniformly distributed in space at a more or less uniform temperature.
Paul Davies further argues that the universe than gradually has been unfolding from this largely featureless state towards its current richness in physical and chemical forms and structures as it is ageing. Or to quote him: “the creative power of nature manifested mainly AFTER the initial flash of existence”. Indeed, the creative ability of nature continues through all time.</p>
<p>Ilya Prigogine was one of the first scientists who developed the theory to explain how matter and energy have the innate ability to bring about self-organising processes. Convection currents are for instance an example of a simple physical process generating massive structures. They can be observed when simply heating a shallow layer of fluid or gas from below, which establishes a temperature gradient that lets the fluids rest state to become unstable. Indeed, the warmer fluid at the bottom is lighter and starts to float to the top where it cools down again, whereas the colder fluid at the top is more heavy and sinks to the bottom, where it is heated. Large ensembles of molecules therefore start to exhibit coherent patterns of motion (see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:convectionCells">2.2</a>).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The convection motion leads to a spontaneous complex spatial organisation, almost a dance, of billions of molecules moving coherently and forming hexagonal convection cells. Such convection cells can be observed in a small dish of a fluid in a lab, up to the level of the earth’s atmosphere and the solar photosphere (see movie below).</p>

<p><em>Movie of the solar photosphere observed with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) on La Palma, Spain. The movie shows solar granulation which is a result of convective motions of bubbles of hot gas that rise from the solar interior. When these bubbles reach the surface, the gas cools and flows down again in the darker lanes between the bright cells. In these so-called intergranular lanes, we can also see small bright points and more extended bright elongated structures. These are regions with strong magnetic fields. (Source: Wikipedia, user Luc.rouppe, link: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Granulation_Quiet_Sun_SST_25May2017.webm" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Granulation_Quiet_Sun_SST_25May2017.webm</a>)</em></p>
<p>Prigogine showed that spontaneous self-organisation also occurs in chemical systems that are operated far from equilibrium by continuously pushing matter and energy through it. These self-organising processes are largely unpredictable and spontaneously arise in our universe.
<span class="citation">Prigogine and Stengers (<a href="#ref-prigogineStengers1984" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span> further argue that such chemical and physical processes are the basis of the complex self-organisation that we observe in living systems.</p>
<p>So instead of clinging to the destructive division of humanity and nature, or to the equally destructive idea that we humans are an incidental and irrelevant feature of the cosmos, we rather can embrace ourselves as children of our universe. A result of its remarkable creativity with a beauty similar to all magnificent self-organising structures that are surrounding us.</p>

<p>The remaining of this chapter builds on the work of five scientists who were very influential and whose insights can help us to increase our understanding on the biological aspects that Rolando Toro included in his Model for Biodanza:</p>
<ul>
<li>Erwin Schrödinger who explicitly defined life as structuring “order-from-disorder”,</li>
<li>Ilia Prigogine who developed the theory for this and coined the term “Dissipative Structures”,</li>
<li>Christian de Duve one of the founding fathers of biochemistry, and</li>
<li>Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela with their concept of autopoiesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, that the subsections in “Christian de Duve: a biochemical view of life” always start with a general overview followed with subsections including more technical details. I have chosen to include these technical details in this monograph because they can help interested readers to understand all terms and concepts that are only touch upon very briefly in the reader of the Biodanza teacher training “Module IV: Biological Principles of Biodanza”. The sections “Maturana and Varela: a Systems View of Life” and “Links to Vital Unconsciousness” are more philosophical in nature.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Schrödinger and Prigogine: a Thermodynamic View of Life<a href="what-is-life.html#schrödinger-and-prigogine-a-thermodynamic-view-of-life" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In his seminal lecture series: “What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell” <span class="citation">Schrödinger (<a href="#ref-schrodinger1944" role="doc-biblioref">1944</a>)</span> defined life as</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>an open system that can generate order from chaos by exploiting external energy sources,</p></li>
<li><p>with the capacity to transmit its own specific blueprint from generation to generation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note, that in his seminal lecture series <span class="citation">Schrödinger (<a href="#ref-schrodinger1944" role="doc-biblioref">1944</a>)</span> also laid out key functions of the molecule that was involved in this specific blueprint and this while DNA was not even discovered.</p>
<p>At first, the property that life can generate order or structure seems to contradict the second law of thermodynamics that states that: a system is always gearing towards maximal entropy.</p>
<p>Entropy can be loosely defined as a physical quantity for the level of how energy is spread out. It is thus the tendency of a system to evolve from a concentrated energy state to an energy state that is more spread out. This can be easily understood from a simple example known to each of us: if you put a hot pot in a large room, the pot will cool down and the temperature in the room will slightly rise until the pot and the room have the same temperature. As a result the concentrated heat energy from the pot is nicely spread out over the entire room.</p>
<p>Schrödinger understood that life was not violating this second law. Indeed, by being an <em>open</em> system, it can interact with the environment, and by eating and breathing there has to be a way of “concentrating order” or maintaining a higher more concentrated energy state.</p>
<p>Prigogine was the first one who provided the theoretical framework for a type of chemistry that is key for life <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-prigogineStengers1984" role="doc-biblioref">Prigogine and Stengers 1984</a>)</span>. He realized that the chemistry of life is totally different from most chemical systems that were studied up to then. Indeed, the chemistry and processes of life are highly non-linear with many feedback loops<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and are operated far from equilibrium by continuously pushing matter and energy through it.</p>
<p>We intuitively know the latter: our body is typically at a higher energy state than the corresponding material in a non-living state. We can simply acknowledge that as we are hotter than the room, and a crude way to estimate how long we are death is by measuring the temperature of a corpse. To maintain our higher energy state, to concentrate chemicals in our cells, and, to build complex molecules, cells and tissues from it, we have to keep on eating and breathing.</p>
<div id="dissipative-structures" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Dissipative structures<a href="what-is-life.html#dissipative-structures" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Prigogine discovered that complex self-organising systems can spontaneously arise if they are open and can exchange lots of energy and matter with their surroundings.
Key for it is a chaos of matter and a flow of energy through the system.
In chemical systems, and life is to a large extent chemistry, the influx of energy allows the generation of structure while producing lots of entropy by dissipation. Dissipation means that energy has been converted from one energy form to another and that it can no longer be converted back in its original form. So dissipation is irreversible, which adds the arrow of time to life. Indeed conversion of energy to heat inherently takes place in all underlying chemical reactions and these cannot be reversed without the addition of new energy. Hence, a large part of the concentrated energy that enters cells through sunlight or chemical energy in food, is spread out in a less concentrated energy form: heat.</p>
<p>The structure that spontaneously emerges in living organisms is thus not violating the second law because of the rise in entropy by the dissipation of heat.
Prigogine therefore coined the novel term dissipative structures for such systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="attractors" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Attractors<a href="what-is-life.html#attractors" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In the reader of the Biodanza teacher training “Module III Vital Unconsciousness and Biocentric Principle” Rolando Toro often uses the term attractor. Dissipative structures typically have multiple attractors, i.e. states, regimes, forms, shapes or structures to which they spontaneously evolve. The specific attractor to which the system is organising itself highly depends on the initial environmental conditions.
Note, that dissipative structures are also characterized by feedback loops.
These feedback loops allow the system to remain at its current attractor upon changes in the environment, e.g. a kind of homeostasis.
However, some environmental stimuli are amplified by the feedback loops and can switch the dissipative structure towards another attractor and thus induce a regime switch.</p>
<p>Prigogine argued that chemistry in cells, cells itself, tissues, organs, organisms, populations of organisms, ecosystems and our globe can be seen as dissipative structures <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-prigogineStengers1984" role="doc-biblioref">Prigogine and Stengers 1984</a>)</span>.
The fruiting body of slime molds are a compelling example of a living system that often changes from attractor, see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:Dictyostelium">2.3</a>. Dictyostelium slime molds, spend most of their lives as separate single-celled amoeba. But, upon stress one of the amoebas releases a chemical signal cAMP. Others detect this signal, and respond in two ways: the amoeba moves towards the signal and secretes more cAMP effectively boosting the signal. So the signal gets amplified by a feedback loop which eventually triggers the system to switch from their current attractor - a state of free living amoebas - towards a novel attractor - their fruiting body - that will release spores and will spread the slime molds towards novel environments (see e.g. youtube movie <a href="https://youtu.be/bkVhLJLG7ug" class="uri">https://youtu.be/bkVhLJLG7ug</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Dissipative zones<a href="what-is-life.html#dissipative-zones" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In the reader of the Biodanza teacher training “Module III Vital Unconsciousness and Biocentric Principle” it is also mentioned that we live in a dissipative zone. Indeed, our whole globe can be seen as a large dissipative structure located in our solar system, which is a dissipative zone.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There is an energy source, the sun that is radiating concentrated energy in photons.</p></li>
<li><p>Life forms are organising structure from the chaos of molecules on Earth by dissipating energy from the solar photons, light and UV, to heat through their organic pigments, e.g. chlorophyll.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals, bacteria and fungi are secondary dissipative structures that are feeding on the concentrated chemical energy in the form of sugar, starch, proteins and fats that are produced by plants and cyanobacteria. They again dissipate energy in the form of heat through respiration.</p></li>
<li><p>The heat produced by life is dissipated to water and air and this induces tertiary dissipative processes like the water cycle, wind and sea currents etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Eventually heat is radiated to space, which acts as an energy sink.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Because the temperature of Earth remains roughly stable, the same amount of energy is radiated to space under the form of heat as what comes in under the form of photons from the sun. As the energy content of heat is lower and more disperse it has a higher entropy than that of the incoming sunlight.
Because almost no mass is exchanged between Earth and space, mass has to be recycled and life is inherently cyclic.</p>
<p>This cyclic nature with its eternal reappearance is key for renewal and vitality, and has been recognized in all human cultures in their rich rituals that celebrate this cyclic origin. Biodanza also recognizes the importance of connecting and resonating with our cyclic origin. Indeed, biological regression in Biodanza is a moment of returning to, connecting with and the reappearance of our origin, which revitalize and initiates processes of renewal on a biological, physiological as well as on a psycho-socio-emotional level.</p>

<p>A vital component of a cell is its membrane that is separating them from their environment while enabling them to interact with it and to concentrate chemicals inside the cell.</p>
<p>Multicellular organisms are composed of multiple cells. The cells are organised in
tissues, e.g. spongy tissue in our bones or epithelium cells of our stomach; organs, e.g. bones or our stomach; organ systems, e.g. skeleton or digestive system; upto the organism. Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:multiCellular">2.5</a> also shows how organisms are further organised in populations of organisms, ecosystems, and eventually our entire Biosphere.

Explained in technical terms, Adinosine-triphosphate (ATP) consists of a ribose sugar with 3 phosphate groups and a base adinine.
Splitting a phosphate group from adinosine-triphosphate (ATP) results in adinosine-diphosphate (ADP), a free phosphate group and energy.

<p>Lipids, fats and oils, are used for storage. However, an important class of lipids, the phospholipids, make up membranes of cells and unicellular compartments called organelles see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:lipids">2.8</a>. Indeed phospholipids have a polar head that likes to be in water and a long apolar tail that does not mix with water. Therefore bilayers of phospholipid molecules are spontaneously formed in aqueous solutions.</p>
<p>Membranes provide the basis for concentrating specific molecules in (compartments of) living cells. This enable cells to build up a disequilibrium of chemical molecules that can perform work as a concentration gradient spontaneously dissipates toward its equilibrium value. So phospholipids are key for creating the boundary conditions necessary for cellular organization.</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1.4.3</span> Amino Acids<a href="what-is-life.html#amino-acids" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>Amino acids by themselves are simple molecules (Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:aminoAcids">2.10</a>).
Although hundreds of amino acids exist in nature, life is using only 20 of them and it is combining them in long molecules, polymers, which are referred to as proteins.
Proteins are hetero-polymers, consisting of the 20 amino acids that are arranged in long sequences that differ from protein to protein.
So unlike starch, that only consists of glucose molecules that are all identical, proteins are capable of carrying information.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The crux of proteins is that their long chain of amino acids spontaneously folds into a complex 3D structure, which is determined by the properties and the specific sequence of its amino acids. From their complex and specific 3D structure their biological function emerges.</p>
<p>Indeed, many proteins work as a “lock” in which specific (bio)molecules fit as a “key”. This enables proteins to bring molecules close together and to promote chemical reactions without being consumed. This process is also referred to as catalysis and proteins that perform catalysis are called enzymes, see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:enzyme">2.11</a>.</p>

<p>Nucleic acids are build of nucleotides.
Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases, which carry the information</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>cytosine [C],</li>
<li>guanine [G],</li>
<li>adenine [A] or</li>

</ol>
<p>a phosphate group and a sugar, i.e. ribose in ribonucleic acid (RNA, Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:RNA">2.13</a>) and deoxyribose in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:DNA">2.14</a>).</p>
<p>These nucleotides are the building blocks that are combined in long polymers: RNA and DNA.
DNA and RNA are hetero-polymers and the nucleotides conceptually can be combined in any order.
So they can contain information.
Indeed, they are key to store and use the genetic information we inherit from our parents.</p>
<p>DNA typically occurs as a double strand, where C and G, and, A and T hybridize to each other using respectively three and two hydrogen bridges to form the iconic double stranded helix structure, see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:DNA">2.14</a>.</p>
<p>There is a general consensus that life probably began by using RNA as information carrier.
DNA, however, is much more stable and lasts longer in water than RNA. Therefore, DNA probably emerged later and is now used to store the genetic information in most organisms.</p>
<p>Life is also one because we share the same genetic code, but we refer to Section <a href="what-is-life.html#lifeInformation">2.3.3</a> “Life is Information” for more details.</p>

<p>“Life is Chemistry” because most chemical reactions are catalyzed, i.e. initiated, promoted and made faster by proteins. The proteins facilitate the reaction without being used. The reactions would never take place if we would only mix the molecules at the concentrations that are typically occurring in a cell.</p>
<p>A catalyst is a chemical substance that helps a reaction to take place without being consumed. Proteins that are catalysts are also referred to as enzymes.</p>
<p>Enzymes are proteins that</p>
<ul>
<li>initiate the reaction</li>
<li>speed up the reaction and</li>
<li>make sure that the outcome is always the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loosely speaking they are</p>
<ul>
<li>“fishing” certain molecules from the complex mixture in a cell,</li>
<li>which consists of thousands of chemical compounds generally at low concentrations,</li>
<li>through binding sites they can facilitate that these molecules (substrates) are getting close so that they can react and form a new compound.</li>
</ul>
<p>These binding sites emerged from to the unique 3D structure of the protein. In Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:enzyme">2.11</a> a schematic overview is given of the enzyme action of a protein.</p>
<p>In most cases enzymes work together in pathways, which consist of multiple chemical reactions for which (part of the) molecules produced in the previous reaction are used by another enzyme to facilitate the next reaction.</p>
<p>The Krebs cycle is a well known example. This pathway is the main source of energy for a cell through metabolising carbohydrates, lipids and/or proteins. The Krebs cycle is a cyclic pathway of multiple chemical reactions each catalyzed by another enzyme (see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:krebsCycle">2.16</a> or the you tube movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yk14dOOvwMk" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/embed/yk14dOOvwMk</a>).</p>
<p>The Krebs cycle is also used to generate building blocks for constructing certain nucleotides and amino acids.</p>

<p>Our genetic information to build all our bio-molecules, which we inherit from our parents, is stored in our DNA. DNA is a hetero-polymer or a long chain of 4 different building blocks, nucleotides. So the genetic information is stored in an alphabet of 4 letters. This is
adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) for DNA.</p>
<p>It makes no physical or chemical difference what the identity of the next nucleotide is in the DNA chain. So our DNA can be seen as a coding system to store and pass genetic information from one generation to the next. Life is therefore also information and not only chemistry.</p>

<p>We can learn an important message from the codon table:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no chemical necessity that explicitly connects the three nucleotides “CGG” to the amino acid arginine rather than to glutamine.</p></li>
<li><p>Nucleotides themselves do not seem to a have chemical connection to the amino acids they encode</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore we call it a code or information rather than just “genetic chemistry”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The code apparently evolved so that many mutations give rise to</p>
<ul>
<li>synonymous codons (same amino acid) or</li>
<li>to incorporate amino acids that are similar</li>
</ul>
<p>so that protein function is conserved.</p>
<p></br></p>
<p>DNA is thus the carrier of genetic information. However, RNA plays a more central role:</p>
<ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Maturana and Varela: a Systems View of Life<a href="what-is-life.html#maturanaVarela" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In the reader of the Biodanza teacher training “Module IV: Biological Aspects of Biodanza” Rolando Toro also introduced the term <em>autopoiesis</em>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Capra and Luisi (<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> write in their book “The Systems View of Life”, that the “term was coined by Varela and Maturana in the 1970s. <em>Auto</em>, of course, means <em>self</em> and refers to the autonomy of self-organising systems; and <em>poiesis</em> (which shares the same Greek root as the word poetry) means <em>making</em>. So, <em>autopoiesis</em> means self-making”.</p>
<p>They continue stating that “the main characteristic of life is self-maintenance due to internal networking of a chemical system that continuously reproduces itself within the boundary of its own making”.</p>
<p>Indeed, a living cell is the smallest autopoietic unit.
The cell consists of a complex internal network of chemical reactions and this within the boundary of its outer membrane.
It can organize itself, maintain itself, can make copies of itself and this with the enzymatic machinery that is present in the cell itself.</p>
<p>Networks of cells are then combined in larger autopoietic units, e.g. </p>
<ul>
<li>our gut microbiome that consists of a network of billions of unicellular bacteria and yeasts from which unique metabolic functions emerge that are essential for digesting our food, or,</li>
<li>our tissues, networks of our own cells from which novel functions emerge, e.g. our thinking that emerges from the complex network of neurons in our brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>An organism or a biological system can therefore not be broken down or reduced to its parts to provide a complete understanding of it. A complete understanding is only possible when it is viewed as a whole.
Indeed, new functions emerge at a higher level from the network that has been formed between its lower-level parts. Varela refers to these properties with the term <em>emergent properties</em>.</p>
<div id="emergent-properties" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Emergent properties<a href="what-is-life.html#emergent-properties" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Emergent properties can be found at each level. At the chemical level, where the protein hemoglobin for instance has the unique property that it can transport oxygen. This property emerges from its unique 3D structure (see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:hemoglobin">2.22</a>). We could never have derived its biological function at the protein-level by breaking it down to its constituting amino acids and only studying the individual properties of each of these amino acids (Note that amino acids are the biological building blocks of proteins).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:hemoglobin"></span>
<img src="figs/hemoglobin.jpeg" alt="Structure of hemoglobin that consists of 4 subunits, each having a heme group with an iron molecule that can bind oxygen. This function emerges from its unique 3D structure (Source: Wikipedia)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.22: Structure of hemoglobin that consists of 4 subunits, each having a heme group with an iron molecule that can bind oxygen. This function emerges from its unique 3D structure (Source: Wikipedia)
</p>
</div>
<p>So hemoglobins’ property to transport oxygen naturally emerges at the protein level upon combining many simple amino acid molecules in the appropriate sequence. Indeed, this specific long chain of amino acid spontaneously folds into a unique 3D structure that gives the hemoglobin protein its unique function.</p>
<p>Lichens are another compelling example of emergent properties (Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:lichen">2.23</a>). Lichens are true colonists. They were among the first organisms that colonized the earth surface.
Indeed, when glaciers pull back lichens appear on the bare hostile rocks and in the course of thousands of years they can convert these rocks into soil, an environment that is fertile for other species. However, their unique and important properties for life on earth could never have been expected when only studying a lichen’s components.</p>

<p>Although lichens macroscopically look like one being, they are effectively two beings: a green algae with the precious gift of photosynthesis that turns sunlight and air into sugars, and, a fungus that provides shelter and is gifted with the art to mine the rocks for minerals, but which cannot make sugars. They are joined in a symbiosis that is so close that their union becomes an entirely new organism. When biologists tried to unravel this unique algal-fungal marriage, they started to grow them in the lab in ideal conditions for both algae and fungus. However, under these conditions they both happily lived next to each other. So the unique properties of lichens could not be delineated from studying both species apart. Only when the scientists exposed them to ecofactors that became so harsh, they teamed up in reciprocity and gained their unique transformative power of turning rocks into fertile environments <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Kimmerer2013" role="doc-biblioref">Kimmerer 2013</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="life-as-an-emergent-property" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Life as an emergent property<a href="what-is-life.html#life-as-an-emergent-property" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><span class="citation">Capra and Luisi (<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> convincingly argue that the same holds at any level and for life itself. Indeed the autopoietic property of a cell originates by properly combining all its molecules in the large networks of chemical reactions from which its structure and organisation, self maintenance, and self replication emerge. We cannot localize life. Life is simply a global property that emerges from the collective interactions of all kind of molecules in a cell, of the collection of cells in a tissue, of the collection of tissues in a organ system, of the collection of organ systems for an organism, of the collection of organisms in a population etc.
At each level we have a network of lower level components from which new properties naturally emerge.</p>
<p>So life itself is an emergent property, it is not present in the parts it originates from, and only emerges when its parts are assembled together correctly. <!-- If we perform the horrific experiment of putting a frog in a blender, life, its ultimate emerging property disappears irrespective from the fact that matter remains to a large extent the same. Studying the frog by solely studying its blended components will not let us understand how a frog is functioning. --></p>

<p>For Maturana and Varela cognition is also inseparable from autopoiesis <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>. Each living organism is an open system that interacts with its environment through its sensory arsenal. It senses its environment, it feeds on its environment, releases products in it, it changes its environment, and, actualizes itself to its environment. The fact that an organism is changing its environment is often overlooked. However, life has dramatically transformed Earth. Indeed, think of photosynthesis for instance that radically changed Earth by the release of the highly reactive molecule oxygen.</p>
<p>An organism at any time in its development is a record of its previous interactions with its environment and that determines its future interactions.
Hence, cognition is a natural product of its evolution.</p>
<p>Varela sees life as a gestalt of three domains <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environment,</li>
<li>Cognition and</li>
<li>The autopoietic unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Life is the synergy of these three domains, which he refers to as the embodied mind.</p>
</div>
<div id="our-social-system-as-an-emergent-property" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.4.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.4</span> Our social system as an emergent property<a href="what-is-life.html#our-social-system-as-an-emergent-property" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The insights of Maturana and Varela have the compelling implication that we no longer need the duality of matter and soul when trying to understand life. Life naturally arises as an emerging property of the large networks of matter or molecules at the level of each individual cell, the basic autopoietic unit, and then new properties emerge at a higher level when combining autopoietic units into tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, populations, etc.</p>
<p>As such, we can also view our cognitive awareness as an emerging property of the network of our neurons in our brain in response to the history of our interactions with our environment. Indeed, consciousness is an expression of life, it is embodied and pathologies can arise when mental processes dissociate from our bodily experiences. Our embodied mind is indeed remarkable. However, in our arrogance we are often blind for the intelligence that emerges in other forms of life. Nevertheless, similar to other species, the unique novel functions and processes that do arise when human entities are forming networks are astounding.</p>
<p>Indeed, at the next level, the network of people, our rich psycho-socio-emotional realm emerges. As human beings, our lives do not only take place in the physical domain, but also in the symbolic social domain, which is also very important for our development. Hence, our behavior in the physical domain is shaped by the “laws of nature”, while our behavior in the social domain is governed by rules that are generated by the social system itself <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>. Moreover, research in the social sciences has pointed out that social networks exhibit the same general principles as biological networks. So, as human beings we develop ourselves in an organised ensemble with internal rules that are generated by the networks and their boundaries, i.e. the physical boundary in our biological networks and the cultural boundary in our social networks <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="shared-bio-logic-from-cell-to-social-system" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.4.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.5</span> Shared “bio-logic” from cell to social system<a href="what-is-life.html#shared-bio-logic-from-cell-to-social-system" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Similar to the biochemical system of a cell, the social system is an open system with social feedback loops. Indeed, each social system needs to sustain itself in a stable but dynamic way, by letting new members, materials and ideas to enter the system, which will in turn be transformed by the internal rules or organisation of the system <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>, leading to a kind of “social homeostasis”. Sometimes, these novel ideas can be so powerful that they transform the social system by itself, i.e. switching it towards a novel attractor. At the individual level, however, the transformation implied by the social system sometimes are a bliss, but they also can cause trauma. The observation that the “bio-logic” or pattern of organisation of a simple cell is similar to that of an entire social structure has large implications.</p>
<p>Indeed, as <span class="citation">Kimmerer (<a href="#ref-Kimmerer2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> points out so convincingly in her book Braiding Sweetgrass, these insights also invites us to learn from all forms of life that are surrounding us.
The lichen example can teach us on our relationships and society. Indeed, in the lab environment when resources were plentiful both the fungus and green algae did not interact, only when the environment became harsh for both of them, they join forces and take their unique lichen form where there are intimately intertwined. A similar disruption of our social function can be seen in our modern western society that is flooded by resources, which cultivates individualism and loneliness.</p>
<p>So this shared bio-logic from cells up to our symbolic realm, suggests a fundamental unity of life <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>, and that studying human development thus requires a unifying perspective, which Rolando Toro deeply embraced when he developed his system of Biodanza.</p>
<p>This bio-psycho-socio-emotional angle, although extremely interesting, is beyond the scope of this monograph as it can give food of thought for an entire monograph on itself.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Links to Vital Unconciousness<a href="what-is-life.html#links-to-vital-unconciousness" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>“Life is One”, all species originated from the same population of ancestral cells, they use the same chemistry, and the same encoding system to store their genetic information.
The wealth of living species, all with their own sensory arsenal, have all been shaped from our last universal common ancestor through evolution by interactions with their environment.
So we can feel that all living beings are intimately connected. Moreover, the emergent properties of networks of living beings follow the same “bio-logic” and suggest a fundamental unity of life.</p>
<p>The cells of living organisms act on internal and external stimuli by producing biochemical molecules, proteins, hormones, neurotransmitters, which in term shape their response and how they interact in their population.
Our response on ecofactors in the environment is largely determined by our embodied mind. This embodied mind emerged from the different levels of autopoietic units of which our organism consists together with the history of the interactions with the environment and social networks that we had ourselves, that our ancestors had and that the species had from which we evolved.</p>
<p>This intimate connection to life that is one, through our embodied mind, is in my opinion what Rolando was referring to with the term <em>vital unconsciousness</em>.</p>
<p>So it becomes clear that all beings are sharing a kind of common cognition and this from ecosystem, population, organism, tissue, down to the cellular level. The latter, which Rolando also referred to as a kind of <em>cellular psychism</em>: with a memory, and an ability for affinity, repulsion, solidarity and communication as well as recognition of similar autopoietic structures in other forms of life.</p>
<p>So this shared <em>psychism</em> or <em>vital unconsciousness</em> encompasses the origin of our instincts, bodily sensations and deeper knowledge that we can experience immediately from our embodied mind. Vivencia is a path to deeply connect, ameliorate and heal the vital unconsciousness, and, this along the five lines of Biodanza.</p>
<p>Now that we developed a basic understanding of important insights that shaped Rolando Toro’s view on life, we will elaborate in the remaining chapters of this monograph on where, how and why biological aspects appear in the Model of Biodanza. Do note, however, that many of the concepts that we will touch upon from a biological perspective also have an important sociological, psychological, emotional and mystic dimension as a very substantial part of our human life takes place in the symbolic social domain.</p>

When the waves are completely out of phase the peak of the first wave aligns with the valley of the second wave and vice versa so their resulting wave will be flat, i.e. both waves cancel eachother out (destructive interference).
