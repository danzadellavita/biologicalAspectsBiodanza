<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> What is Life?<a href="what-is-life.html#what-is-life" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>This chapter builds on the work of five scientists who were very influential and who shaped Rolando Toro’s views on the biological aspects that he incorporated in his Model for Biodanza:</p>
<ul>
<li>Erwin Schrödinger who explicitly defined life as structuring “order-from-disorder”,</li>
<li>Ilia Prigogine who developed the theory for this and coined the term “Dissipative Structures”,</li>
<li>Christian de Duve one of the founding fathers of biochemistry and from whom Rolando borrowed the phrase that “Life is an obligatory manifestation of matter, written into the fabric of the universe”, and</li>
<li>Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela with their concept of autopoiesis,</li>
</ul>
<p>on which we will elaborate in the sections below. I will also link them to two core concepts of Biodanza: the Biocentric Principle and Vital Unconsciousness.</p>
<div id="schrödinger-and-prigogine-a-thermodynamic-view-of-life" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Schrödinger and Prigogine: a Thermodynamic View of Life<a href="what-is-life.html#schrödinger-and-prigogine-a-thermodynamic-view-of-life" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In his seminal lecture series: “What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell” <span class="citation">Schrödinger (<a href="#ref-schrodinger1944" role="doc-biblioref">1944</a>)</span> defined life as</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>an open system that can generate order from chaos by exploiting external energy sources,</p></li>
<li><p>with the capacity to transmit its own specific blueprint from generation to generation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note, that in his seminal lecture series <span class="citation">Schrödinger (<a href="#ref-schrodinger1944" role="doc-biblioref">1944</a>)</span> also laid out key functions of the molecule that was involved in this specific blueprint and this while DNA was not even discovered.</p>
<p>At first, the property that life can generate order or structure seems to contradict the second law of thermodynamics that states that: a closed system is always gearing towards maximal entropy.</p>
<p>Entropy can be loosely defined as a physical quantity for the level of how energy is spread out. It is thus the tendency of a closed system to evolve from a concentrated energy state to an energy state that is more spread out. This can be easily explained with an example that is well known to anyone: if you put a hot pot in a large room, the pot will cool down and the temperature in the room will slightly rise until the pot and the room have the same temperature. As a result the concentrated heat energy from the pot is nicely spread out over the entire room.</p>
<p>Schrödinger understood that life was not violating this second law. Indeed, by being an open system, it can interact with the environment, and by eating and breathing there has to be a way of “concentrating order” or maintaining a higher more concentrated energy state.</p>
<p>Prigogine was the first to provide the theoretical framework for a type of chemistry that is key for life <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-prigogineStengers1984" role="doc-biblioref">Prigogine and Stengers 1984</a>)</span>. He realized that the chemistry of life is totally different from most chemical systems that were studied up to then. Indeed, the chemistry and processes of life are highly non-linear with many feedback loops and are far from equilibrium.</p>
<p>We intuitively know the latter: a living system is typically at a higher energy state than the corresponding material in a non-living state. We can simply acknowledge that as we are hotter than the room, and a crude way to estimate how long we are death is by measuring the temperature of a corpse. To maintain our higher energy state we have to keep on eating and breathing in order to stay warm, to concentrate chemicals in our cells and to build ordered molecules with a high chemical energy content from it.</p>
<p>Prigogine discovered that complex self-organizing systems can spontaneously arise if they are open and can exchange lots of energy and matter with their surroundings.
Key for it is a chaos of matter and a flow of energy through the system.
In chemical systems, and life is to a large extent chemistry, the influx of energy allows the generation of structure while producing lots of entropy by dissipation. Dissipation means that energy has been converted from one energy form to another and that it can no longer be converted back in its original form. So dissipation is irreversible, which adds the arrow of time to life. Indeed conversion of energy to heat inherently takes place in all underlying chemical reactions and these chemical reactions cannot be reversed without the addition of new energy. Hence, a large part of the concentrated energy that enters cells through sunlight or chemical energy in food, is spread out in a less concentrated energy form: heat.
The structure that spontaneously emerges in living organisms is thus not violating the second law because of the rise in entropy by the dissipation of heat.
Prigogine therefore coined the novel term dissipative structures for such systems.</p>
<p>In the module of the Biodanza teacher training on the Biocentric Principle Rolando Toro often uses the term attractor. Dissipative structures typically have multiple attractors, i.e. states, regimes, forms, shapes or structures to which they spontaneously evolve. The specific attractor to which the system is organizing itself highly depends on the initial environmental conditions.
Note, that dissipative structures are also characterized by feedback loops.
These feedback loops allow the system to remain at its current attractor upon changes in the environment.
However, some environmental stimuli are amplified by the feedback loops and can switch the dissipative structure towards another attractor and thus induce a regime switch.</p>
<p>Prigogine argued that chemistry in cells, cells itself, tissues, organs, organisms, populations of organisms, ecosystems and our globe can be seen as dissipative structures <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-prigogineStengers1984" role="doc-biblioref">Prigogine and Stengers 1984</a>)</span>.
The fruiting body of slime molds are a compelling example of the change of the attractor of a living system, see figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:Dictyostelium">2.1</a>. Dictyostelium slime molds, spend most of their lives as separate single-celled amoeba. But, upon stress one of the amoebas releases a chemical signal cAMP. Others detect this signal, and respond in two ways: the amoeba moves towards the signal and secretes more cAMP effectively boosting the signal. So the signal gets amplified by a feedback loop which eventually triggers the system to switch from their current attractor: a state of free living amoebas towards a novel attractor: their fruiting body that will release spores and will spread the slime molds towards novel environments (see e.g. you tube movie <a href="https://youtu.be/bkVhLJLG7ug" class="uri">https://youtu.be/bkVhLJLG7ug</a>).</p>

</p>
<p>In the module of the Biodanza teacher training on the Biocentric Principle it is also mentioned that we live in a dissipative zone. Indeed, our whole globe can be seen as a large dissipative structure located in our solar system, which is a dissipative zone.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There is an energy source, the sun that is radiating concentrated energy in photons.</p></li>
<li><p>Life organises structure from the chaos of molecules on Earth by dissipating energy from the solar photons, light and UV, to heat through their organic pigments, e.g. chlorophyll.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals, bacteria and fungi are secondary dissipative structures that are feeding on the concentrated chemical energy in the form of sugar, starch, proteins and fats that are produced by plants and cyanobacteria. They again dissipate energy in the form of heat through respiration.</p></li>
<li><p>The heat produced by life is dissipated to water and air and this induces tertiary dissipative processes like the water cycle, wind and sea currents etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Eventually heat is radiated to space, which acts as an energy sink.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Because the temperature of Earth remains roughly stable, the same amount of energy is radiated to space under the form of heat as what comes in under the form of photons from the sun. As the energy content of heat is lower and more disperse it has a higher entropy than that of the incoming sunlight.
Because almost no mass is exchanged between Earth and space, mass has to be recycled and life is inherently cyclic.</p>
<p>Prigogine showed that dissipative structures spontaneously emerge as soon as there is a chaos of mass/chemicals available and an energy source and sink, which generates an energy flow through the system.
This is also what happened on Earth. Earth exists about 4.5 billion years and a soon as there was water on Earth, life spontaneously emerged in less than 3 million years.</p>

<p>A vital component of a cell is its membrane that is separating them from their environment while enabling them to interact with it and to concentrate chemicals inside the cell.</p>
<p>Multicellular organisms are composed of multiple cells. The cells are organised in</p>
<ul>
<li>tissues, e.g. spongy tissue in our bones or epithelium cells of our stomach,</li>
<li>organs, e.g. bones or our stomach,</li>

<p>“Life is One” because all living organisms use the same “energy coin”, the ATP-ADP system, to store and reuse energy.
Adinosine-triphosphate (ATP) consists of a ribose sugar with 3 phosphate groups and a base adinine.
Splitting a phosphate group from adinosine-triphosphate (ATP) results in adinosine-diphosphate (ADP), a free phosphate group and energy.

<p>Lipids, fats and oils, are used for storage. However, an important class of lipids, the phospholipids, make up membranes of cells and unicellular compartments called organelles see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:lipids">2.6</a>. Indeed phospholipids have a polar head that likes to be in water and a long apolar tail that does not mix with water. Therefore bilayers of phospholipid molecules are spontaneously formed in aqueous solutions.</p>
<p>Membranes provide the basis for concentrating specific molecules in (compartments of) living cells. This enable cells to build up a disequilibrium of chemical molecules that can perform work as a concentration gradient spontaneously dissipates toward its equilibrium value. So phospholipids are key for creating the boundary conditions necessary for cellular organization.</p>

<p>Amino acids by themselves are simple molecules (Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:aminoAcids">2.8</a>).
Although hundreds of amino acids exist in nature, life is using only 20 of them and it is combining them in long molecules, polymers, which are referred to as proteins.
Proteins are hetero-polymers, consisting of the 20 amino acids that are arranged in long sequences that differ from protein to protein.
So unlike starch, that only consists of glucose molecules that are all identical, proteins are capable of carrying information.</p>

</div>
<p>The crux of proteins is that their long chain of amino acids spontaneously folds into a complex 3D structure, which is determined by the properties and the specific sequence of its amino acids. From their complex and specific 3D structure their biological function emerges.</p>
<p>Indeed, many proteins work as a “lock” in which specific (bio)molecules fit as a “key”. This enables proteins to bring molecules close together and to promote chemical reactions without being consumed. This process is also referred to as catalysis and proteins that perform catalysis are called enzymes, see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:enzyme">2.9</a>.</p>

<p>Nucleic acids are build of nucleotides.
Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases, which carry the information</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>cytosine [C],</li>

<p>a phosphate group and a sugar, i.e. ribose in ribonucleic acid (RNA, Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:RNA">2.11</a>) and deoxyribose in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:DNA">2.12</a>).</p>
<p>These nucleotides are the building blocks that are combined in long polymers: RNA and DNA.
DNA and RNA are hetero-polymers and the nucleotides conceptually can be combined in any order.
So they can contain information.
Indeed, they are key to store and use the genetic information we inherit from our parents.</p>
<p>DNA typically occurs as a double strand, where C and G, and, A and T hybridize to each other using respectively three and two hydrogen bridges to form the iconic double stranded helix structure, see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:DNA">2.12</a>.</p>
<p>There is a general consensus that life probably began by using RNA as information carrier.
DNA, however, is much more stable and lasts longer in water than RNA. Therefore, DNA probably emerged later and is now used to store the genetic information in most organisms.</p>
<p>Life is also one because we share the same genetic code, but we refer to Section <a href="what-is-life.html#lifeInformation">2.2.3</a> “Life is Information” for more details.</p>

<p>“Life is Chemistry” because most chemical reactions are catalyzed, i.e. initiated, promoted and made faster by proteins. The proteins facilitate the reaction without being used. The reactions would never take place if we would only mix the molecules at the concentrations that are typically occurring in a cell.</p>
<p>A catalyst is a chemical substance that helps a reaction to take place without being consumed. Proteins that are catalysts are also referred to as enzymes.</p>
<p>Enzymes are proteins that</p>
<ul>
<li>initiate the reaction</li>
<li>speed up the reaction and</li>
<li>make sure that the outcome is always the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loosely speaking they are</p>
<ul>
<li>“fishing” certain molecules from the complex mixture in a cell,</li>
<li>which consists of thousands of chemical compounds generally at low concentrations,</li>
<li>through binding sites they can facilitate that these molecules (substrates) are getting close so that they can react and form a new compound.</li>
</ul>
<p>These binding sites emerged from to the unique 3D structure of the protein. In Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:enzyme">2.9</a> a schematic overview is given of the enzyme action of a protein.</p>
<p>In most cases enzymes work together in pathways, which consist of multiple chemical reactions for which (part of the) molecules produced in the previous reaction are used by another enzyme to facilitate the next reaction.</p>
<p>The Krebs cycle is a well known example. This pathway is the main source of energy for a cell through metabolizing carbohydrates, lipids and/or proteins. The Krebs cycle is a cyclic pathway of multiple chemical reactions each catalyzed by another enzyme (see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:krebsCycle">2.14</a> or the you tube movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yk14dOOvwMk" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/embed/yk14dOOvwMk</a>).</p>

adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) for DNA. In RNA thymine (T) is replaced by uracil (U).
It makes no physical or chemical difference what the identity of the next nucleotide in the chain is. So they can seen as a coding system to store and pass genetic information from one generation to the next. Life is therefore also information and not only chemistry.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:transcriptionTranslation">2.18</a> shows the process of transcription of a gene from DNA to RNA and the translation of RNA to proteins.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The transcription of DNA to RNA is initiated by opening the
DNA double strand. Then a complementary RNA strand is synthesized by exploiting that A hybridizes to U (or T) and G to C through hydrogen bounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Once that the complementary RNA strand is made, it is further processed in the nucleus into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels from the cell nucleus to the cell cytosol (cell liquid) where it is translated into proteins, and, where the majority of the reactions take place.</p></li>
<li><p>There mRNA is translated into proteins by ribosomes.
In the ribosomes the mRNA is bound to transfer RNA (tRNA). tRNA can bind to the mRNA molecule if it has 3 consecutive nucleotides that are complementary to the triplet of the 3 consecutive nucleotides on the mRNA template that is lying in the ribosome.</p></li>
<li><p>The transfer RNA transports one specific amino-acid that is then incorporated in the protein that is being formed, which is the growing amino acid chain in Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:transcriptionTranslation">2.18</a>. The sequence of 3 consecutive nucleotides of DNA of a gene is therefore also called a <em>codon</em> because it encodes for a specific amino acid.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon incorporation, the ribosome shifts to the next triplet of the mRNA and the next transfer RNA is bound to it, and so on until a stop codon is reached and the protein is finished.</p></li>

<p>There are in total 64=4<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> codons encoding for each of the 20 amino acids, and, for a start and a stop codon to initiate and stop the protein translation, respectively. Hence, there is a redundancy in the code, see <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:codonTable">2.19</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>We can learn an important message from the codon table:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no chemical necessity that explicitly connects the three nucleotides “CGG” to the amino acid arginine rather than to glutamine.</p></li>
<li><p>Nucleotides themselves do not seem to a have chemical connection to the amino acids they encode</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore we call it a code or information rather than just “genetic chemistry”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The code apparently evolved so that many mutations give rise to</p>
<ul>
<li>synonymous codons (same amino acid) or</li>
<li>to incorporate amino acids that are similar</li>
</ul>
<p>so that protein function is conserved.</p>
<p></br></p>
<p>DNA is thus the carrier of genetic information. However, RNA plays a more central role:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messenger RNA brings the genetic information from the cell nucleus to the cell cytosol where they are translated into proteins and where most of the chemical reactions take place.</li>
<li>Ribozymes, i.e. catalytic RNA molecules, initiate and speed up particular reactions</li>
<li>Transfer RNA plays an crucial role in the translation of proteins</li>
<li>An RNA primer, i.e. a small RNA molecule, is essential to copy DNA</li>
<li>RNA also acts as carrier of genetic information, e.g. corona virus.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Maturana and Varela: a Systems View of Life<a href="what-is-life.html#maturana-and-varela-a-systems-view-of-life" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In the theory of the module on Biological Aspects of Biodanza Rolando Toro also introduced the term <em>autopoiesis</em>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Capra and Luisi (<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> write in their book “The Systems View of Life”, that the “term was coined by Varela and Maturana in the 1970s. <em>Auto</em>, of course, means <em>self</em> and refers to the autonomy of self-organizing systems; and <em>poiesis</em> (which shares the same Greek root as the word poetry) means <em>making</em>. So, <em>autopoiesis</em> means self-making”.</p>
<p>They continue stating that “the main characteristic of life is self-maintenance due to internal networking of a chemical system that continuously reproduces itself within the boundary of its own making”.</p>
<p>Indeed, a living cell is the smallest autopoietic unit.
The cell consists of a complex internal network of chemical reactions and this within the boundary of its outer membrane.
It can organize itself, maintain itself, can make copies of itself and this with the enzymatic machinery that is present in the cell itself.</p>
<p>Networks of cells are then combined in larger autopoietic units, e.g. </p>
<ul>
<li>our gut microbiome that consists of a network of billions of unicellular bacteria and yeasts from which unique metabolic functions emerge that are essential for digesting our food, or,</li>
<li>our tissues, networks of our own cells from which novel functions emerge.</li>
</ul>
<p>An organism or a biological system can therefore not be broken down or reduced to its parts to provide a complete understanding of it. A complete understanding is only possible when it is viewed as a whole.
Indeed, new functions emerge at a higher level from the network that has been formed between its lower-level parts. Varela refers to these properties with the term <em>emergent properties</em>.</p>
<p>Emergent properties can be found at each level. At the chemical level, where the protein hemoglobin for instance has the unique property that it can transport oxygen. This property emerges from its unique 3D structure of four sub-units each with an iron atom at its center (see Figure <a href="what-is-life.html#fig:hemoglobin">2.20</a>). We could never have derived its biological function at the protein-level by breaking it down to its constituting amino acids and only studying the individual properties of each of these amino acids.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:hemoglobin"></span>
<img src="figs/hemoglobin.jpeg" alt="Structure of hemoglobin that consists of 4 subunits, each having a heme group with an iron molecule that can bind oxygen. This function emerges from its unique 3D structure (Source: Wikipedia)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.20: Structure of hemoglobin that consists of 4 subunits, each having a heme group with an iron molecule that can bind oxygen. This function emerges from its unique 3D structure (Source: Wikipedia)
</p>
</div>
<p>So hemoglobins’ property to transport oxygen naturally emerges at the protein level upon combining many simple amino acid molecules in the appropriate sequence. Indeed, this specific long chain of amino acid spontaneously folds into a unique 3D structure that gives the hemoglobin protein its unique function.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Capra and Luisi (<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> convincingly argue that the same holds at any level and for life itself. Indeed the autopoietic property of a cell originates by properly combining all its molecules in the large networks of chemical reactions from which its structure and organisation, self maintenance, and self replication emerge.</p>
<p>We cannot localize life. Life is simply a global property that emerges from the collective interactions of all kind of molecules in a cell, of the collection of cells in a tissue, of the collection of tissues in a organ system, of the collection of organ systems for an organism, of the collection of organisms in a population etc.
At each level we have a network of lower level components from which new properties naturally emerge.</p>
<p>So life itself is an emergent property, it is not present in the parts it originates from, and only emerges when its parts are assembled together correctly. If we perform the horrific experiment of putting a frog in a blender, life, its ultimate emerging property disappears irrespective from the fact that matter remains to a large extent the same. Studying the frog by solely studying its blended components will not let us understand how a frog is functioning.</p>
<p>For Maturana and Varela cognition is also inseparable from autopoiesis <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>. Each living organism is an open system that interacts with its environment through its sensory arsenal. It senses its environment, it feeds on its environment, releases products in it, it changes its environment, and, actualizes itself to its environment. The fact that an organism is changing its environment is often overlooked. However, life has dramatically transformed Earth. Indeed, think of photosynthesis for instance that radically changed Earth by the release of the highly reactive molecule oxygen.</p>
<p>So an organism at any time in its development is a record of its previous interactions with its environment and that determines its future interactions.
Hence, cognition is a natural product of its evolution.</p>
<p>Varela sees life as a gestalt of three domains <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environment,</li>
<li>Cognition and</li>
<li>The autopoietic unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Life is the synergy of these three domains, which he refers to as the embodied mind.</p>
<p>The insights of Maturana and Varela have the compelling implication that we no longer need to duality of matter and soul when trying to understand life. Life naturally arises as an emerging property of the large networks of matter or molecules at the level of each individual cell, the basic autopoietic unit, and then new properties emerge at a higher level when combining autopoietic units into tissues, organs, organ systems, communities, etc.</p>
<p>As such, we can also view our cognitive awareness as an emerging property of the network of our neurons in our brain in response to the history of our interactions with our environment, and this without needing the concept of the soul as an explanation.</p>

<p>“Life is One”, all species originated from the same population of ancestral cells, they use the same chemistry, and the same encoding system to store their genetic information.
The wealth of living species, all with their own sensory arsenal, have all been shaped from our last universal common ancestor through evolution by interactions with their environment.
So we can feel that all living beings are intimately connected.</p>
<p>The cells of living organisms act on internal and external stimuli by producing biochemical molecules, proteins, hormones, neurotransmitters, which in term shape their response.
Our response on ecofactors in the environment is largely determined by our embodied mind. This embodied mind emerged from the different levels of autopoietic units of which our organism consists together with the history of the interactions with the environment that we had ourselves, that our ancestors had and that the species had from which we evolved.</p>
<p>This intimate connection to life that is one, through our embodied mind, is in my opinion what Rolando was referring to with the term <em>vital unconsciousness</em>.</p>
<p>So it becomes clear that all beings are sharing a kind of common cognition and this from ecosystem, population, organism, tissue, down to the cellular level. The latter which Rolando also referred to as a kind of <em>cellular psychism</em>: with a memory, and an ability for affinity, repulsion, solidarity and communication as well as recognition of similar autopoietic structures in other forms of life.</p>
<p>So this <em>cellular psychism</em> or <em>vital unconsciousness</em> encompasses the origin of our instincts, bodily sensations and deeper knowledge that we can experience immediately from our embodied mind, without interference of our cognitive mind. Vivencia is a path to deeply connect, ameliorate and heal the vital unconsciousness, and, this along the five lines of Biodanza.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Links to the Biocentric Principle<a href="what-is-life.html#links-to-the-biocentric-principle" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>I introduced the Biocentric principle in Section <a href="intro.html#sectionBiocentricPrinciple">1.2</a>. When formulating his principle, Rolando started from the axiom that “life is the essential condition for the genesis of the universe”.</p>
<p>From my background as a scientist this axiom does not seem to be a requirement for the deep effects and properties that can be deduced from the Model of Biodanza. It seems somewhat connected to the question “What came first: the chicken or the egg?” For me, biocentrism “an sich” i.e., starting from the deep astonishment that life as we know it simply exists and put it at the hearth of our weltanschauung, is a sufficient condition for the entire system of Biodanza.</p>
<p>This comprehension also triggered me not to elaborate on the “Principi di Vita Cosmica” explicitly in Section <a href="intro.html#sectionModelOfBiodanza">1.3</a> “Model of Biodanza” in the introduction. Nevertheless, I feel that the introduction is entirely line with Rolando’s method that starts from the simple fact that Life exists, here and now, and that knowledge originates through the Vivencia of Life itself. The latter triggers us to think about our origin and our place in the universe, and, more importantly to simply experience and deeply know it from within, and this without the burden of a mental process standing in between.</p>
<p>Prigogine and Stengers’ book “Order Out of Chaos” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-prigogineStengers1984" role="doc-biblioref">Prigogine and Stengers 1984</a>)</span>, Capri and Luigi’s book “The Systems View of Life” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>, and, Rolando’s axiom of the biocentric principle, however, invited me to rethink my definition of “Life”. Instead of the narrow interpretation of “Life as something biological”, I am pervaded by a broader vision originating from the astonishment and power that lies in dissipative self-organizing structures that are so omnipresent in our universe, and, of Capri’s and Luigi’s view that the whole biosphere can be viewed as a large autopoietic unit.</p>
<p>From this broader vision, can’t we discern movement, dance, vitality, or life in dissipative self-organizing physical phenomena like a tornado or a swirling solar wind? And would this not allow us to define the dissipative structure to which such a natural system far from equilibrium organizes itself, its attractor, simply as Rolando did by referring to it as “Life” itself? Is this what Rolando meant with his quote that “the universe is a living hologram”? So, was my choice to omit the “Principi di Vita Cosmica” in the introduction not simply a matter of semantics?</p>
<p>Now that we developed a basic understanding of how Rolando Toro viewed life, we will elaborate in the remaining chapters of this monograph on where, how and why the biological aspects can be found in the Model of Biodanza.</p>
