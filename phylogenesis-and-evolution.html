<p>All species evolved from the same ancestral population of cells.
This is also referred to as the same Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).
In the tree of life the evolutionary relations are summarized between different organisms (and groups of organisms). All living beings eventually can be traced back to the last universal common ancestor who is located at the root of the tree, see Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:treeOfLifeBis">4.2</a>.</p>

<p>(Source: naturedocumetaries.org)</p>
<p>At its origin about 4.5 Billion Years Ago (BYA) the Earth was black, a hot basalt rock and dust in a cold vacuum.
As the Earth cooled down she became Grey Earth (4.3 BYA) as she was mainly covered by granite and rocks. Another 500 million years later she was covered with liquid water: Blue Earth (3.8 BYA).</p>
<p>In only 300 million years she radically changed into Red Earth (3.5 BYA) due to life. Indeed, cyanobacteria emerged that can do photosynthesis and produce oxygen, a very reactive molecule. This led all free iron in the ocean to precipitate as iron oxide or rust (red). There was an explosion of the number of minerals, they went from approximately 250 to more than 5000 mineral species. Oxygen also caused a mass extinction because only few organisms could cope with its highly reactive nature. The coming 3 billion years life on Earth stayed relatively similar.</p>
<p>Around 540 MYA Earth was struck by a large ice age, White Earth.
Again leading to a mass extinction due to the cold. However, volcanic activity came to the rescue by producing greenhouse gasses and an atmosphere that could retain more heat.</p>
<p>In less than 20 million years (MY) Earth radically changed again and turned into Green Earth (520 MYA). There was an explosion of life, and life suddenly evolved from being mainly unicellular to complex multicellular forms.</p>

<ul>
<li>Eukaryota are larger and more complex cells, 10-100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span> in size. They have a variety of internal membrane-bound structures, called organelles, and a cytoskeleton, which play an important role in defining the cell’s organization and shape. Eukaryotic DNA is stored in chromosomes. A chromosome is a long DNA molecule that is stored in a compact form. A chromosome contains a part or all of the genetic material of an organism. Human cells have 46 chromosomes, i.e. 23 chromosome pairs. Each pair consists of one copy from our biological mother and one from our biological father. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus, which is the organelle maintaining the integrity of chromosomes and thus of our genes, and plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and of the activities of the cell. See Figures <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:animalCell">4.4</a> and <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:plantCell">4.5</a>.</li>

<p>From 3.5 BYA - 540 MYA we find mainly prokaryotic and some simple eukaryotic organisms in fossils and life was mainly unicellular.</p>
<p>Eukaryotic cells are believed to be generated by endosymbiosis, i.e. a symbiotic relationship where one organism lives inside the other, which is beneficial for both organisms.</p>
<p>The process of endosymbiosis that led to eukaryotic cells is displayed in Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:endosymbiosis">4.6</a>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>First an anaerobic<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> prokaryotic cell was assumed to have grown and to have developed membrane systems inside the cell, which gave rise to the formation of the nucleus. At a certain point of time this large prokaryotic cell with internal membrane systems must have ingested an aerobic<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> proteobacterium, which managed to avoid digestion. The two cells started with an endosymbiotic relation.</p>
<p>The proteobacterium provided the host cell with additional energy through the synthesis of ATP by metabolizing carbohydrates and lipids using oxygen and the host cell fed the proteobacterium with these bio-molecules. This gave the endosymbiotic pair the ability to grow further in size and to thrive in the oxygen rich environment of planet Earth that was established during the Cambrian era that started 540 million years ago. The increase of oxygen is believed to be one of the major triggers that gave rise to the “biological big bang” that led to an explosion of novel species and the emergence of all large groups<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> in the animal kingdom <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-he2019" role="doc-biblioref">He et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>During their endosymbiotic evolution the proteobacterium gradually handed over many genes to the cell nucleus, and became under regulation of the nucleus. It eventually evolved to mitochondria, the organelles that are the energy plants of a cell. So, we inherit more from mother than father: we inherit our cell structure as well as our energy system, i.e. our mitochondria and their remaining DNA, from mother side through her egg cell.</p>
<p>For plant cells, a second endosymbiotic event must have occurred with eukaryotic cells and cyanobacteria. The ingested cyanobacteria has evolved in a similar way into chloroplasts, which give plants the ability for photosynthesis and led them become the most successful life form of the globe. Fossil evidence of land plants dates back to 485 MYA - 420 MYA, however, phylogenetic analysis also suggests an earlier origin in the Cambrian <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-StrotherFoster2021" role="doc-biblioref">Strother and Foster 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Other key differences between Prokaryota and Eukaryota are in terms of their reproduction.
For Prokaryota that only takes place by cell division. A mutation in the DNA is thus fixed in all daughter cells. While nearly all Eukaryota have a phase of sexual reproduction. They are diploid organisms, i.e. they have two copies of each gene, one from fathers’ and mothers’ side. This enables successive mutations to be made in one copy because another functional copy of the gene is available. Moreover during sexual reproduction recombination of chromosomes occurs, i.e. reshuffling of paternal and maternal genes, which leads to much more variation.</p>
<p>The Eukaryota further evolved in protists, which are unicellular organisms, fungae, plants and animals.</p>

<p>How does the evolution of LUCA to all species of the tree of life occurred?
Evolution is largely driven by variability and selection.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Variability and Selection<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#variability-and-selection" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Variation occurs, among others, through errors in the copying of DNA for cell division of prokaryotic cells and gamete<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> production for eukaryotic cells (see Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:dnaPolymerase">4.7</a>).</p>

Note, again the link between energy and information. Errors are often corrected by proofreading. However, some of the errors remain.
</p>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<p>The error margin of DNA replication is 1 error per billion base pairs that are copied, which can lead to point mutations. Note, that we humans have a genome size of about 6.4 billion base pairs.</p>
<p>Other sources of variability are</p>
<ul>
<li>Insertions or deletions, i.e. base pairs that are added or removed, respectively.</li>
<li>Recombination, reshuffling of genetic traits, e.g. during sexual reproduction</li>
</ul>
<p>Most mutations are neutral, i.e. the mutated codon encodes for the same amino acid. Neutral mutations can be used as a molecular/genetic clock to tell how far apart two species are in an evolutionary sense.</p>
<p>But, mutations are not always neutral! For instance, sickle cell anemia is caused by one point mutation in hemoglobin (see Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:sickleCell1">4.8</a> and <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:sickleCell2">4.9</a>). A T (thymine base) is mutated to an A (adenine base), which results in a codon that encodes for the amino acid valine instead of glutamic acid. This causes dramatic changes to the 3D structure of the hemoglobin protein and causes a deformation of the red blood cells from a round to sickle shape, which leads to anemia.</p>
<p>Why does this mutation remain? It mainly occurs in Africa, where the mutation for sickle cell anemia is selected because it makes affected individuals resistant against malaria, which gives them a evolutionary competitive advantage despite their anemia. However, offspring who inherit the mutation of both parents are not viable. Therefore, the regular variant of hemoglobin also remains.</p>

</div>
<p>Hence, evolution is a natural process that is driven by two opposing forces: variation and selection.</p>
<p>Variation occurs by spontaneous copy errors in genetic code or mutations, among others.</p>
<p>Selection occurs upon ecofactors: Is a mutation beneficial or harmful for a particular organism in its specific environment?
The odds on fixation of the mutation thus depends on the reproductive success.</p>
<p>The process of genetic variation and selection can eventually lead to evolution of new species upon many generations.</p>

<div id="genetic-drift" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Genetic Drift<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#genetic-drift" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Another important process for the origin of species is genetic drift. This are random fluctuations of alleles, which are particular sequence variants of a gene. Genetic drift is particularly strong in small populations. As opposed to selection it is not adaptive.</p>
<p>New species will thus originate more quickly when a small fraction of the population gets isolated in a new environment.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Horizontal Gene Transfer<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#horizontal-gene-transfer" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Horizontal gene transfer, which is non-sexual transfer of genetic information between two distinct organisms, is also important for the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>This is very common between Prokaryota, i.e. eubacteria and archaea bacteria, think on the super bugs in hospitals that acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics. It also occurs between Eukaryota. Mainly in protists, which are unicellular organisms with a nucleus. As well as between Prokaryota on the one hand and Eukaryota on the other hand.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> Endosymbiosis<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#endosymbiosis-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Endosymbiosis is also a very important driver of evolution. Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould have shown that the fossil record indicates that evolution happens in bursts: it is slow most of the time until suddenly rapid changes occur over a brief time <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-margulis1999" role="doc-biblioref">Margulis 1999</a>)</span>. According to Lynn Margulis this can be explained due to endosymbiosis, where one species starts to live within another species, which is a source of evolutionary novelty that can give rise to an explosion of novel life forms. We already touched in more detail upon an important endosymbiosis event in section <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#endosymbiosis">4.1.2</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="teleonomy" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.5</span> Teleonomy<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#teleonomy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The term teleonomy means that evolution only has the primitive goal to maintain and reproduce the species, and, that it thus has no other purpose and thus also no direction.</p>
<p>When complex organs and organisms originate it might seem as if there is a direction or purpose, but, that is not the case! A good example is the development of an eye, see Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:evolutionEye">4.10</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:evolutionEye"></span>
<img src="figs/evolutionEye.png" alt="The evolution of an eye (Source: Wikipedia)" width="45%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.10: The evolution of an eye (Source: Wikipedia)
</p>
</div>
<p>Indeed,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The eye is not developed by evolution with the purpose to see.</p></li>
<li><p>The eye only has the function to see.</p></li>
<li><p>It is the result of a gradual process where each adaptation gave a reproductive advantage in a particular environment.</p></li>
<li><p>In another environment it can be no longer functional and than it might disappear or might become dysfunctional, e.g. moles eyes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the origin of a species is the result of evolution, but, not the purpose of evolution. Evolution is thus adaptation with as sole goal maintenance and reproduction.</p>
<p>From the distribution of the complexity of species in Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:distributionComplexity">4.11</a>, it is clear that the most abundant species in number always has been bacteria.
Indeed, evolution has no direction.
The distribution of complexity at present, however, has a tail to the right.
This mainly stems from the fact that there is lower bound of complexity of living organisms. Hence, evolution could not generate organisms with a complexity below this lower bound and it therefore only seems as if it slightly favors increasing complexity.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Note, that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plants are the most successful group in terms of the mass of carbon that they fixate.</p></li>
<li><p>Bacteria clearly dominate the more complex animal kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals represent a relative small fraction. Among animals, cattle and humans are over represented.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other compelling evidence that there is no direction to evolution stems from the number of bacterial cells in our body. <span class="citation">Sender, Fuchs, and Milo (<a href="#ref-Sender2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> showed that the ratio of the number of bacterial cells to the number of human cells is close to 1. A human with a weight of 70kg has <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 38 trillion bacterial cells and 30 trillion humane cells. Note, that trillion is a thousand billion or 10<span class="math inline">\(^{12}\)</span>!</p>
<p>So, all these examples make clear that evolution has no direction. For every organism with a higher complexity there also emerge many organisms with lower complexity! However, we can view evolution as a creative process that is generating novel life forms that are well adapted to their environment.</p>

<p>Indeed, our upright walking life style gave our hands a new freedom that allowed homonids to make and use tools and weapons. This stimulated rapid brain development that eventually gave rise to the evolution of language and human consciousness, which is closely entwined with the evolution of technology and social relations <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="consciousness" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Consciousness<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#consciousness" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>With this evolution a second type of consciousness arose, which is referred to as extended consciousness (see e.g. <span class="citation">Capra and Luisi (<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>). So on the one hand we have primary consciousness that is the cognitive process that is accompanied by basic perceptual, sensory and emotional experience, which gives an organism a sense of self here and now, and, is widespread among living organisms. On the other hand, extended consciousness involves a more elaborate self-awareness, an experience of identity, the ability for reflection and to hold mental images, which eventually enabled us to formulate values, beliefs, goals and strategies. From the evolution of language not only an inner world of concepts and ideas emerged but also a social world with organised relationships and culture <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-capraLuisi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Capra and Luisi 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This organised social world has been key for our reproductive success. But, also came with profound consequences for our global ecosystem, which we changed in unprecedented ways. Our social organisation and human technology enabled us to make a giant jump from hominids who typically had a position in the middle of the food chain towards our position at the top of the food chain <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Harari2015" role="doc-biblioref">Harari 2015</a>)</span>. Other species at the top of the food chain evolved over a course of millions of years into that position, which enabled ecosystems to slowly adapt to them. We, humans, however, took this spectacular leap so quickly that the ecosystem and our own psycho-emotional system had no time to adjust. Indeed, top predators are majestic creatures full of confidence as they evolved over millions of years with almost no natural enemies, while mankind took that position so quickly that we are still confronted with the fears and anxieties that are associated to species with a position at the middle of the food chain <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Harari2015" role="doc-biblioref">Harari 2015</a>)</span>, which can have far reaching consequences on how we act and react. Therefore, it is key that we learn to connect to our numinous unconsciousness. So that we learn to connect to our greatness with humbleness, and, as such can evolve from a species that often exploits the world into a position as guardians of all the beauty that is surrounding us.</p>
<p>Similar to biology, our social culture also evolves, but at a much faster and ever increasing pace.
Our current social culture, however, overemphasizes our extended consciousness, which led in extremis to the radical humanism of Decartes, which is summarized in his famous quote “je pense donc je suis”.</p>
<p>Our self, however, is a mental image, which is very nicely worded by Brad Blanton in his book “Radical Honesty”: “We are the Being, the source of being and remembering. The creator of our own universe. We awaken in the womb into the ocean of experiences. Over a long period of time, that ocean becomes a sea of suggestions. We lose track of the ocean of experiences. We lose track of having created the sea. After we have lost track of everything sufficiently, we continue to interact with the sea and create a self. What we call the self is a creation of further interactions of the sea of suggestion. The being we were when we began, the being we actually still are, alive in an ocean of experience, including all the ocean as itself, recedes to the background of our attention, and the self we have created comes to the foreground. As we identify with our newly created self, we lose touch with the being we are and have been since light came on.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Blanton1996" role="doc-biblioref">Blanton 1996</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This has also been confirmed in scientific experiments. <span class="citation">Kahneman (<a href="#ref-Kahneman2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>, for instance, showed in his cold water experiments that we have an experiencing self, which refers to our primary consciousness that resides in the ocean of experiences, and, a remembering or narrative self associated with our extended consciousness that can create mental images and memories of our experiences, which both play an important role in our decision making. In these experiments he exposed people to two treatments. In one treatment, a person’s hand was immersed in cold water at 14 degrees for 1 minute. In the other treatment, he immersed their hand in water at 14 degrees for 1 minute, which is as annoying as the first treatment, and then the water temperature was raised to 15 degrees, which is only slightly less annoying, for an additional 30 seconds. Our experiencing self would never consider that extending the treatment with an episode of slightly warmer water makes the whole episode more appealing. But, when people were asked almost everyone preferred the longer treatment where the water is less cold at the end. Storing experiences happens according to a peak/end rule, i.e. according to the maximum intensity of the experience and its ending, and, it is our remembering self that makes decisions. The peak/end rule is a heuristic that evolved biologically and allows us to quickly and efficiently store experiences without the burden to remember every instant of the entire episode. This rule works very well in general, however, it can lead to peculiar choices in specific situations.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Thinking fast and slow<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#thinking-fast-and-slow" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In his book Thinking, Fast and Slow <span class="citation">Kahneman (<a href="#ref-Kahneman2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> also discusses many other heuristics that lie at the heart of our decision-making. Indeed, he pointed out that we have two systems, a fast system and a slow system.</p>
<p>Fast thinking happens when facing problems that comes to mind automatically, e.g. when seeing a picture of an angry person we immediately know that they is angry. This way of thinking happens through our instincts, emotions, intuition and associative activation. Experiences and words evoke memories, which evoke emotions that in turn trigger physiological responses, facial expressions and other reactions. This all happens extremely quickly and all at once and results in a self-reinforcing pattern of integrated cognitive, emotional, physiological and physical responses.</p>
<p>Slow thinking involves mental work and happens when we face problems for which the solution does not come to mind or that do not seem trivial. It is strongly associated with our extended consciousness. Note, however, that Kahneman points out that our slow thinking is also embodied. Indeed, during the slow thinking process our muscles tense up, our blood pressure rises, our heart rate increases and our pupils dilate, among others. Although many humans experience themselves as independent individuals who make their decisions in a rational and well thought out way, <span class="citation">Kahneman (<a href="#ref-Kahneman2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> further argues that the majority of our decision making happens through fast thinking.</p>

<p>It is thus important for our well-being to be well connected to our instincts and emotions. Indeed, as Rolando Toro pointed out, our instincts and emotions are the result of million of years of evolution. They are a cognition that has been shaped to maintain and reproduce our species, and are the result of the environments and evolutionary development that our ancestors, i.e. humans and other species from which we evolved, underwent up to this point.</p>
<p>In our current society, however, there is a large emphasis on our extended consciousness. Moreover, information technology such as social media are also designed to hack our fast thinking process with the sole purpose to manipulate us for economic purposes. Together with the repression of our emotions and instincts this can invoke a dissociation between our cognitive processes, our bodily experiences and our needs, which in turn can lead to psycho-emotional pathologies. With Biodanza we strengthen our identity and with exercises evoking biological regression we feed our primary consciousness, which lets us reconnect with our perceptual, sensory and emotional experiences, and, our instincts, here and now. This can restore our primary cognition that has evolved over the course of millions of years. The vivencia can reactivate vital physiological and psycho-emotional processes and can have a deep impact on our being. Moreover, in the reactivation phase of the session, we reactivate our extended consciousness and often color our mental images and memories with the deep vivencial experience.</p>
<!-- As a final remark, Rolando Toro also shared the view that the genetic information of a species can be seen as a record of the environments and evolutionary development that it underwent up to this point. -->
<p>Now that we introduced how all species could evolve from their last universal common ancestor and touched upon some specific evolutionary aspects of our human species, we are ready to make the transition to how we humans evolve in our life span. This is also referred to as ontology, which is a another crucial biological aspect in the Model of Biodanza and is our focus in the next chapter.</p>
