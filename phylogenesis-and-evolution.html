<p>At its origin about 4.5 Billion Years Ago (BYA) the Earth was black, a hot basalt rock and dust in a cold vacuum.
As the Earth cooled down she became Grey Earth (4.3 BYA) as she was mainly covered by granite and rocks. Another 500 million years later she was covered with liquid water: Blue Earth (3.8 BYA).</p>
<p>In only 300 million years she radically changed into Red Earth (3.5 BYA) due to life. Indeed, cyanobacteria emerged that can do photosynthesis and produce oxygen, a very reactive molecule. This led all free iron in the ocean to precipitate as iron oxide or rust (red). There was an explosion of the number of minerals, they went from approximately 250 to more than 5000 mineral species. Oxygen also caused a mass extinction because only few organisms could cope with its highly reactive nature. The coming 3 billion years life on Earth stayed relatively similar.</p>
<p>Around 540 MYA Earth was struck by a large ice age, White Earth.
Again leading to a mass extinction due to the cold. However, volcanic activity came to the rescue by producing greenhouse gasses and an atmosphere that could retain more heat.</p>
<p>In less than 20 million years (MY) Earth radically changed again and turned into Green Earth (520 MYA). There was an explosion of life, and life suddenly evolved from being mainly unicellular to complex multicellular forms.</p>

<ul>
<li>Eukaryota are larger and more complex cells, 10-100 <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span> in size. They have a variety of internal membrane-bound structures, called organelles, and a cytoskeleton, which play an important role in defining the cell’s organization and shape. Eukaryotic DNA is stored in chromosomes. A chromosome is a long DNA molecule that is stored in a compact form. A chromosome contains a part or all of the genetic material of an organism. Human cells have 46 chromosomes, i.e. 23 chromosome pairs. Each pair consists of one copy from our biological mother and one from our biological father. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus, which is the organelle maintaining the integrity of chromosomes and thus of our genes, and is controlling the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression. The nucleus can, therefore, be viewed as the control center of the cell, see Figures <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:animalCell">4.4</a> and <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:plantCell">4.5</a>.</li>

<p>From 3.5 BYA - 540 MYA we only find mainly prokaryotic and some simple eukaryotic organisms in fossils and life was mainly unicellular.</p>
<p>Eukaryotic cells are believed to be generated by endosymbiosis, i.e. a symbiotic relationship where one organism lives inside the other, which is beneficial for both organisms.</p>
<p>The process of endosymbiosis that led to eukaryotic cells is displayed in Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:endosymbiosis">4.6</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:endosymbiosis"></span>

<p>First a prokaryotic cell was assumed to have grown and to have developed membrane systems inside the cell, which gave rise to the formation of the nucleus. At a certain point of time this large prokaryotic cell with internal membrane systems must have ingested a proteobacterium, which managed to avoid digestion. The ingested proteobacterium must have been able to use oxygen in its metabolism. The two cells started with an endosymbiotic relation.</p>
<p>The proteobacterium provided the cell with additional energy and the host cell fed the proteobacterium with nutrients. This gave the endosymbiotic pair the ability to grow further in size and to thrive in the oxygen rich environment of planet Earth that was established during the Cambrian era that started 540 million years ago. The increase of oxygen is believed to be one of the major triggers that gave rise to the “biological big bang” that led to an explosion of novel species and the emergence of all large groups (phyla) in the animal kingdom <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-he2019" role="doc-biblioref">He et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>During their endosymbiotic evolution the proteobacterium gradually handed over a number of its genes to the cell nucleus, and became under regulation of the nucleus. It eventually evolved to mitochondria, the organelles that are the energy plants of a cell. So, we inherit more from mother than father: we inherit our cell structure and energy system from mother side through her egg cell.</p>
<p>For plant cells, a second endosymbiotic event must have occurred with eukaryotic cells and cyanobacteria. The ingested cyanobacteria has evolved in a similar way into chloroplasts, which give plants the ability for photosynthesis and led them become the most successful life form of the globe. Fossil evidence of land plants dates back to 485 MYA - 420 MYA, however, phylogenetic analysis also suggests an earlier origin in the Cambrian <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-StrotherFoster2021" role="doc-biblioref">Strother and Foster 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Other key differences between Prokaryota and Eukaryota are in terms of their reproduction.
For Prokaryota that only takes place by cell division. A mutation in the DNA is thus fixed in all daughter cells. While nearly all Eukaryota have a phase of sexual reproduction. They are diploid organisms, i.e. they have two copies of each gene, one from fathers’ and mothers’ side. This enables successive mutations to be made in one copy because another functional copy of the gene is available. Moreover during sexual reproduction recombination of chromosomes occurs, i.e. reshuffling of paternal and maternal genes, which leads to much more variation.</p>
<p>The Eukaryota further evolved in protists, which are unicellular organisms, fungae, plants and animals.</p>

<p>How does the evolution of LUCA to all species of the tree of life occurred?
Evolution is largely driven by variability and selection.</p>
<div id="variability-and-selection" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Variability and Selection<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#variability-and-selection" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Variation occurs, among others, through errors in the copying of DNA for cell division of prokaryotic cells and gamete production for eukaryotic cells (see Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:dnaPolymerase">4.7</a>).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<p>The error margin of DNA replication is 1 error per billion base pairs that are copied, which can lead to point mutations. Note, that we humans have a genome size of about 6.4 billion base pairs.</p>
<p>Other sources of variability are</p>
<ul>
<li>Insertions or deletions, i.e. base pairs that are added or removed, respectively.</li>
<li>Recombination, reshuffling of genetic traits, e.g. during sexual reproduction</li>
</ul>
<p>Most mutations are neutral, i.e. the mutated codon encodes for the same amino acid. Neutral mutations can be used as a molecular/genetic clock to tell how far apart two species are in an evolutionary sense.</p>
<p>But, mutations are not always neutral! For instance, sickle cell anemia is caused by one point mutation in hemoglobin (see Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:sickleCell1">4.8</a> and <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:sickleCell2">4.9</a>). A thymine is mutated to an adenine, which results in a codon that encodes for the amino acid valine instead of glutamic acid. This causes dramatic changes to the 3D structure of the hemoglobin protein and causes a deformation of the red blood cells from a round to sickle shape, which leads to anemia.</p>
<p>Why does this mutation remain? It mainly occurs in Africa because sickle cell anemia also makes affected individuals resistant against malaria, which gives them a evolutionary competitive advantage despite their anemia. However, offspring that inherits the mutation of both parents is not viable.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Evolution<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#evolution-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Evolution is a natural process that forms the basis of the origin of species (bacteria, fungi, plants, animals).</p>
<p>It is driven by two opposing forces: variation and selection</p>
<p>Variation occurs by spontaneous copy errors in genetic code or mutations, among others.</p>
<p>Selection occurs upon ecofactors. Is a mutation beneficial or harmful for a particular organism in its specific environment.
The odds on fixation of the mutation thus depends on the reproductive success.</p>
<p>The process of genetic variation and selection can eventually lead to new species upon many generations.</p>
</div>
<div id="genetic-drift" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Genetic Drift<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#genetic-drift" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Another important process for the origin of species is genetic drift. This are random fluctuations of alleles, which are particular sequence variants of a gene. Genetic drift is particularly strong in small populations. As opposed to selection it is not adaptive.</p>
<p>New species will thus originate more quickly when a small fraction of the population gets isolated in a new environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="horizontal-gene-transfer" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> Horizontal Gene Transfer<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#horizontal-gene-transfer" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A last process that introduces variation is horizontal gene transfer, in example non-sexual transfer of genetic information between two distinct organisms.</p>
<p>This is very common between Prokaryota, i.e. eubacteria and archaea bacteria, think on the super bugs in hospitals that acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics. It also occurs between Eukaryota. Mainly in protists, which are unicellular organisms with a nucleus. As well as between Prokaryota on the one hand and Eukaryota on the other hand.</p>
</div>
<div id="teleonomy" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.5</span> Teleonomy<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#teleonomy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The term teleonomy means that evolution only has the primitive goal to maintain and reproduce the species, and, that it thus has no purpose or direction.</p>
<p>When complex organs and organisms originate it might seem as if there is a direction or purpose, but, that is not the case! A good example is the development of an eye, see Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:evolutionEye">4.10</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:evolutionEye"></span>
<img src="figs/evolutionEye.png" alt="The evolution of an eye (Source: Wikipedia)" width="45%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.10: The evolution of an eye (Source: Wikipedia)
</p>
</div>
<p>Indeed,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The eye is not developed by evolution with the purpose to see.</p></li>
<li><p>The eye only has the function to see.</p></li>
<li><p>It is the result of a gradual process where each adaptation gave a reproductive advantage in a particular environment.</p></li>
<li><p>In another environment it can be no longer functional and than it might disappear or might become dysfunctional, e.g. moles eyes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the origin of a species is the result of evolution, but, not the purpose of evolution. Evolution is thus adaptation with as sole goal maintenance and reproduction.</p>
<p>From the distribution of the complexity of species in Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:distributionComplexity">4.11</a>, it is clear that the most abundant species in number always has been bacteria.
Indeed, evolution has no direction.
The distribution of complexity at present, however, has a tail to the right.
This mainly stems from the fact that there is lower bound of complexity of living organisms. Hence, evolution could not generate organisms with a complexity below this lower bound and it therefore only seems as if it slightly favors increasing complexity.</p>

<p><span class="citation">Bar-On, Phillips, and Milo (<a href="#ref-Bar-On2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> published the distribution of carbon mass fixated in different types of species in Figure <a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#fig:carbonFixated">4.12</a>, which also shows that there is no preference towards more complex organisms.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:carbonFixated"></span>
<img src="figs/pnas.1711842115fig01.jpg" alt="Mass in giga tons of carbon for different groups of species. (Bar-On, Phillips, and Milo 2018)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Note, that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plants are the most successful group in terms of the mass of carbon that they fixate.</p></li>
<li><p>Bacteria clearly dominate the more complex animal kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals represent a relative small fraction. Among animals, cattle and humans are over represented.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other compelling evidence that there is no direction to evolution stems from the number of bacterial cells in our body. <span class="citation">Sender, Fuchs, and Milo (<a href="#ref-Sender2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> showed that the ratio of the number of bacterial cells to the number of human cells is close to 1. A human with a weight of 70kg has <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 38 trillion bacterial cells and 30 trillion humane cells. Note, that trillion is a thousand billion or 10<span class="math inline">\(^{12}\)</span>!</p>
<p>So, all these examples make clear that evolution has no direction. For every organism with a higher complexity there also emerge many organisms with lower complexity!</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Evolution of Evolution<a href="phylogenesis-and-evolution.html#evolution-of-evolution" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>First there was</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Chemical evolution: the selection of building blocks and complex chemistry.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, biological evolution of cells/organisms based on the selection of genetic information and function.</p></li>
<li><p>And finally, our species introduced cultural evolution that can bypass natural evolution using</p>
<ul>
<li>artificial selection: breeding of plants, pets, cattle, genetic manipulation, etc.</li>
<li>Technology: that enables us for a fast adaptation to new environments</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>As a final remark, Rolando Toro also shared the view that the genetic information of a species can be seen as a record of the environments and development that it underwent up to this point.</p>
<p>Now that we introduce how all species could evolve from their last universal common ancestor, we are ready to make the transition to how we humans evolve in our life span. This is also referred to as ontology, which is a another crucial biological aspect in the Model of Biodanza, which is our focus in the next chapter.</p>
