# Principles of Cosmic Life and the Genesis of Life

The biological aspects are the vertical axis of the Model of Biodanza. 
At the bottom of the model, we first encounter the Principles of Cosmic Life and the Genesis of Life, which are indicate with the red box in Figure \@ref(fig:modelCosmic).

```

We will start with the genesis of the universe and we conclude with the genesis of life. 

## Genesis of Universe

An overview of the evolution of our universe is given in Figure \@ref(fig:evolutionUniverse).

```

The most common theory is that our cosmos started with the Big Bang. 
A very energy-rich state.  

By expanding the universe quickly cooled down enough for energy to be converted into mass, i.e. the majority in hydrogen and a fraction in more heavy helium nuclei. 



### Genesis of Stars

Under the influence of the gravitational force, matter then started to cluster in nebula, gaseous clouds essentially consisting of hydrogen (H) and helium (He). 

Due to concentration difference in these first nebula, the cloud further contracts and eventually imploded (See Figure \@ref(fig:genesisStar)). 

```{r genesisStar, fig.cap='Genesis of the first stars (Source: universe-review.ca)', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.8, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("https://universe-review.ca/I08-13-firststars6.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/I08-13-firststars6.jpeg")
```


Extreme heating in the nebula that imploded by gravity gave rise to a condition in which all matter was in the form of a super hot plasma.
In such a plasma nuclear fusion spontaneously takes place. In this process light atoms are combined into more heavy atoms and much energy is released.

First all hydrogen atoms are converted into helium (\@ref(fig:nuclearFusion)). 

```{r nuclearFusion, fig.cap='Nuclear Fusion of hydrogen to the more heavy helium (Source: Sarang, Wikipedia)', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.8, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/fusion.svg")
```

If all hydrogen in a star is used, the fusion stops because the activation energy to convert helium to lithium is to high (Figure \@ref(fig:fusionEnergy)).

```{r fusionEnergy, fig.cap='Energy liberated by nuclear fusion. In a star nuclear fusion happens until Iron (Source: Wikipedia)', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.8, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/fusionEnergy.png")
```

Therefore, the star cools down, implodes and subsequently explodes into a supernova (see Figure \@ref(fig:supernova)). During the supernova nuclear fusion further occurs towards more heavy elements up to iron (Figure \@ref(fig:fusionEnergy)) and these elements are projected in the universe.

```{r supernova, fig.cap='Supernova of a star (Source:  www.universetoday.com)', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.8, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hires.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/hires.jpeg")
```

The supernova gives rise to new nebula and these will eventually lead to new stars and the whole process begins all over. 

Hence, through nuclear fusion in the stars the more heavy atoms have been generated of which the bio-molecules of life are eventually built. So we are built out of cosmic dust!

### Carbohydrates in Interstellar Space

Upon nuclear fusion in the stars many different elements are formed. For life, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorous and nitrogen atoms, among others, are key to compose organic matter. 

In interstellar space, carbon reacts spontaneously with other elements to form poly-aromatic carbohydrates  (PAHs). This is for instance visible in a photograph of the Cat's paw nebula (Figure \@ref(fig:catPawNebula)). In the green regions radiation of hot stars induces fluorescence of PAHs. 

```{r catPawNebula, fig.cap='Cat\'s Paw nebula, in the green regions radiation of hot stars induces fluorescence of PAHs (Source: NASA/JPL-Caltech, Wikipedia)', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.8, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/orionWithPAH.jpeg")
```    

These PAHs were generated shortly after the Big Bang and they are further transformed in interstellar space via hydrogenation (reaction with hydrogen), oxygenation (reaction with oxygen) and other processes to form precursor molecules for amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and, nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA and DNA. So simple building blocks, molecules that are essential for the chemistry of life are already omnipresent in space. 

This together with the fact that chemistry is deterministic under the prevailing physical-chemical conditions let Christian de Duve to formulate his quote that "Life is an obligatory manifestation of matter, written into the fabric of the universe" [@deDuve2002]. 


## Genesis of Life 

In a remote corner of our milky way, an average galaxy, an average planet was formed, which we know as our planet Earth. 
After the Earth cooled down liquid water was formed. Water is a peculiar molecule and it has the unique feature to form hydrogen bounds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of different molecules (see Figure \@ref(fig:water)). 

```{r water, fig.cap='Structure of water. A unique feature of water is that it forms hydrogen bounds indicated by (1) (Source: Wikipedia)', out.width='25%', fig.asp=.8, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/3D_model_hydrogen_bonds_in_water.svg")
```    

These hydrogen bounds cause water to be liquid at higher temperatures than what we would expect based on the small size of the molecule. It also makes water to freeze with volume increase! Water has its lowest volume while it is liquid at 4Â°C. These unique features of liquid water are essential for life as we know it. 

So on earth unique conditions emerged that made abiogenesis or the *genesis of life* from non-living matter possible. The exact process that lead to life is unknown and will probably remain so. 
However, a general rationale is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:originOfLife).

```{r originOfLife, fig.cap='Stages in the origin of life range from well-understood, such as the abiotic synthesis of simple organic molecules, to largely unknown, like the origin of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) with its complex molecular functionalities. (Source: Chiswick Chap, Wikipedia)', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.8, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/origin_of_life_stages.svg")
```  

Abiogenesis has been initiated by a chemical evolutionary process that gave rise to organic molecules with increasing complexity. It is a general consensus that first RNA molecules emerged formed from free nucleotides, which are closely related to our energy coin ATP and ADP. RNA molecules are known to be catalytic and are carriers of genetic information. They are known to replicate themselves under anoxic conditions (in the absence of oxygen) and in the presence of iron. Conditions that occurred at young planet Earth (e.g. @Williams2013). These RNA molecules evolved either alone, the RNA-world hypothesis, or already in conjunction with proteins.  

Next, it is assumed that prebiotic molecules, which could self-replicate were encapsulated by phospholipids that also had emerged to form a protocell with a membrane.
In these protocells a further chemical evolution was possible separated from the environment, which ultimately lead to a self-replicating and self-organizing cell built from the four essential type of bio-molecules of life: lipids, carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids. 

Further biological evolution of these first living cells eventually gave rise to our last universal common ancestor (LUCA).
LUCA must have had at least 355 genes, which all living organisms have in common.
LUCA was anaerobic, living without oxygen, and maintained its hereditary material with DNA, the genetic code, and produced proteins from RNA templates in ribosomes. LUCA retrieved its energy from oceanic volcanic activity in deep sea vents, i.e. the intensely hot plumes caused by seawater interacting with magma erupting through the ocean floor. 

Now, that we introduced the genesis of life, we can focus on the tale of the evolution of LUCA into all species of the tree of life, a process which is also referred to as phylogenesis.
